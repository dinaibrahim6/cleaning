# Cow Health Monitoring Analysis

This repository contains the results of an analysis, cleaning, and visualization of a cow health monitoring dataset. The dataset was collected to track various health metrics and conditions of a group of cows over time. In this project, we have performed the following tasks:

## Analysis

- Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, size, and the types of data it contains.
- Performed statistical analysis to uncover patterns and insights related to cow health.
- Conducted data profiling to identify missing values, outliers, and anomalies within the dataset.
  ## Visualization

- Created visualizations, including plots and charts, to better understand the data and communicate findings.
- Developed informative graphs to illustrate trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.
- Utilized tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebooks for visualization.

## Project Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
